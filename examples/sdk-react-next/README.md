## Getting Started

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Citymapper API key to the file.

If you do not have an API key sign up at [enterprise.citymapper.com](https://enterprise.citymapper.com).

Then you can run the application:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
